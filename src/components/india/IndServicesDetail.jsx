                        When you’re designing your site, it’s easy to get caught up in adding too many elements to your pages. You want your site to be visually appealing, you continually add elements to add another dimension of visual interest to your page. This can lead to your site getting cluttered and overwhelming. The other issue is that, if certain elements don’t have a purpose on your site, it can leave your audience confused. Every element on your site should have a purpose. Imagine putting a call to action (CTA) button that doesn’t lead to a new page.

                    <p className="font-montserrat text-[18px] text-gray-400 pr-2">
                        People would constantly try to click on the button, and it would leave them confused as to why it doesn’t take them somewhere. Or, think what would happen if a website design prompted users to “Call now” on a top-of-the-funnel blog post. People probably wouldn’t click. Create elements that are functional and enhance the user experience on your site. </p>
