You want your site to be visually appealing, you continually add elements to add another dimension of visual interest to your page. This can lead to your site getting cluttered and overwhelming. The other issue is that, if certain elements don’t have a purpose on your site, it can leave your audience confused. Every element on your site should have a purpose. Imagine putting a call to action (CTA) button that doesn’t lead to a new page.',
